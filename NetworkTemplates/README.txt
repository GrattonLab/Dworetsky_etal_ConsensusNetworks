This folder contains two versions of the network templates used to produce individual-specific network maps in Dworetsky et al., 2021. Templates are provided in both Talairach and MNI space as NIfTI files.

NOTE: Templates were originally created in Talairach space, and maps were then transformed into MNI;  the cortical map is generous, but may have a slight cutoff at the back of the brain.
