The file called 151ProbabilisticROIs_t88.txt contains coordinates and network information for 151 high-probability ROIs. The first three columns contain each region's coordinates (x,y,z) in Talairach space. The fourth column contains the network name to which each ROI was assigned, and the fifth column contains the corresponding network number label if using the 'power surf' color palette in Connectome Workbench. The sixth column contains the peak probability value across all voxels contained within the 7mm-diameter ROI.

The NIfTI file 151ProbabilisticROIs.nii contains the 151 ROIs in volume (Talairach) in the same numbered order as the text file described above. The NIfTI file 151ProbabilisticROIs_Networks.nii contains the ROIs in volume (Talairach) color-coded by their Workbench network label.

The file called Probabilistic_Network_Maps_t88_333.zip contains a Workbench scene file which loads each of the 14 networks' probabilistic maps into a separate tab in Workbench, such that clicking on a voxel on any map will bring up an Information window displaying that voxel's probability of network membership to all 14 networks. The probabilistic network maps are overlaid on a brain in 711-2B space, which conforms to the Talairach atlas. (The scene file itself is located within the 'Users' folder when the zipped file is expanded.)
